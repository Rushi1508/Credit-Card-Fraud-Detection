This repository contains a Python script that implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for fraud detection using a dataset from the financial domain. 
The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions based on various features.

Introduction:
Fraud detection is a crucial task in the financial sector to identify and prevent fraudulent activities. 
This script leverages the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on their features.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this script is download from Kaggle.(link for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charlesbeauchamp/ps-20174392719-1491204439457-logcsv)
Download the dataset and replace the path with the actual path on your device.

Visualization:
The script generates a pie chart visualizing the distribution of fraud and non-fraud instances in the dataset.

Note:
Can change the number of clusters as per user choice by changing the value of k(line 40)
